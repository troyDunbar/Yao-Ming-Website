# Yao-Ming-Website
Final project for HTML5 course where you had to create your own webpage from scratch that included multiple pages, hyperlinks, images, and page manipualtion. 

This is a webpage to tell the story of Yao Ming through multiple webpages and images.

This was created by me for my final project of Html5. The webpage was written in HTML5 and CSS. It is a basic wepage designed to display fundametnal knowledge of HTML and CSS and to represent the possibilities of these languages together.
