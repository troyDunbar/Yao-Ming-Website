  <h2>The Houtston Rockets chose Yao Ming as the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft. He did not play with the Houston Rockets until after pre-season
   though due to him playing for China in the FIBA World Championship.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>Yao was voted to start for the West over O'Neal, who was coming off three consecutive NBA Finals MVP Awards. Yao received nearly a
    quarter million more votes than O'Neal, and he became the first rookie to start in the All-Star Game since Grant Hill in 1995.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>Yao finished his rookie season averaging 13.5 points and 8.2 rebounds per game, and was second in the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.
    Also a unanimous pick for the NBA All-Rookie First Team selection and being voted the Sporting News Rookie of the Year.</h2>
